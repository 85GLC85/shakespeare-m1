  <h1>William Shakespeare: A Brief History</h1>
  <div>
    <p> One William Shakespeare born in the 1600s in Britain is best known as a playwright of global renown his work
      rippling forth into the 21st century and possibly beyond. From influencing Baz Luhrmann’s Romeo and Juliet created
      in the 1990s to movies such as 10 Thing’s I Hate About You and Othello Shakespeare’s work lives to this day much
      like the lines of the famous sonnet 18.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p> <br>Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?</br>
      <br>Thou art more lovely and more temperate:</br>
      <br>Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,</br>
      <br>And summer’s lease hath all too short a date;</br>
      <br>Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shine</br>
      <br>And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;</br>
      <br>And every fair from fair sometime declines,</br>
      <br>By chance or nature’s changing course untrimm'd;</br>
      <br>But thy eternal summer shall not fade,</br>
      <br>Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st;</br>
      <br>Nor shall death brag thou wander’st in his shade,</br>
      <br>When in eternal lines to time thou grow’st:</br>
      <br> So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,</br>
      <br> So long lives this, and this gives life to thee</br>

      -Sonnet 18
      <p>
  </div>
  <div>
    </div>
  <p>
    <br>From his very first play his very first folio to his final sonnet -a famed poet too – he made his mark in
    history covering themes which have universal appeal from the tragic to the comic.</br>
    <br><strong>His place of birth?</strong></br>
    <br>The British Isles, Warwickshire, Stratford-upon-Avon </br>
    <br><strong>His creative stomping grounds?</strong /></br>
    <br>London, with his first play’s inception on stage in the late 1500s. </br>
    <br>With his own playhouse to showcase his work The Globe Theatre and a new version on London’s Southbank in modern
    times along with the rose travelling theatre in York replicating on stage accurately the traffic of Shakespeare’s
    play. <br>
    
    <div>
      <p>
        <strong>CHORUS</strong>
        <br>Two households, both alike in dignity</br>
        <br>(In fair Verona, where we lay our scene),</br>
        <br>From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,</br>
        <br>Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.</br>
        <br>From forth the fatal loins of these two foes</br>
        <br>A pair of star-crossed lovers take their life,</br>
        <br>Whose misadventured piteous overthrows</br>
        <br>Doth with their death bury their parents' strife.</br>
        <br>The fearful passage of their death-marked love</br>
        <br>10And the continuance of their parents' rage,</br>
        <br>Which, but their children’s end, naught could remove,</br>
        <br>Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage—</br>
        <br>The which, if you with patient ears attend,</br>
        <br>What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.</br>
      </p>
      <div>
        <br>
       <p> <strong>Shakespeare’s First Play</strong></p>
       <p> <br>This is a cause for debate among various scholars of Shakespeare and there is no definitive answer at
        present. Earlier plays include The Taming of the Shrew, The Two Gentleman of Verona, Henry VI. </br></p>
       <p> <br><strong>Shakespeare’s First Sonnet published 20th May 1609…</strong></br></p>
       <p> <br>…and his last sonnet 154 published 1609.</br></p>
       <p> <br>Interesting fact – then Shakespeare had his own theatre troupe and Royal Patronage The King’s Men. </br>
        <br>Now there is the Royal Shakespeare Company. </br></p>
        <div>
         <p> <br><strong>Shakespeare’s Contemporaries</strong></br>
          <br>Although Shakespeare has survived the flotsam and jetsam of time many of his contemporaries did not fare
          as well on the waves, much like The Tempest – another play of Shakespeare’s – their works are marooned on an
          island without global exposure. The British Isles produced the likes of Ben Fletcher, Ben Jonson, Christopher
          Marlow, John Donne and John Webster to name but a few of Shakespeare’s contemporaries. Their plays survive
          them, as do the works of one William Shakespeare. </br></p>
          <div>
            <h3>Early Life</h3>
            <p>Born to John Shakespeare and Mary Arden one of eight children, very little survives of Shakespeare in
              terms of biography. It is assumed William Shakespeare was educated in Stratford upon Avon, married at
              eighteen to one Anne Hathaway aged twenty-six and bore three children of whom an elder daughter and twins.
              His son Hamnet whose name is thought to have inspired the play Hamlet and may be memorialised in sonnet 18
              passed away in boyhood inspiring the novel <em>Hamnet</em> by Maggie O'Farrell published in 2020 showing
              Shakespeare's far reaching appeal from beyond the grave. </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Mid Life</h3>
            <p>Shakespeare’s profession prior to playwriting is unknown it is speculated that he was a teacher. A move
              from Stratford upon Avon to London occurred at some juncture and history altering events began to take
              place with the formation of an acting career and ideas taken from quill to scrolls of paper in the form of
              his own plays and poems.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Later Life</h3>
            <p>Retiring to Stratford following an eventful life in London Shakespeare passed away and post humously his
              plays were published in a folio by two actors from The King’s Men troupe in 1623 seven years after his
              death. </p>

              <h3>Famous Plays</h3>

              <p>From the romance - and tragedy - of the first meeting of Romeo and Juliet and its religious overtones
                to pilgrimage to the magic of The Tempest there is something for everyone to be found in Shakespeare.
              </p>
             <p> <br> Romeo If I profane with my unworthiest hand</br>
              <br>This holy shrine, the gentle sin is this:</br>
              <br>My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand</br>
              <br>To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.</br>
              <br>Juliet Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much.</br>
              <br>Which mannerly devotion shows in this,</br>
              <br>For saints have hands that pilgrims’ hands do touch.</br>
              <br>And palm to palm is holy palmers’ kiss.</br></p>

             <p> <br>Romeo Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?</br>
              <br>Juliet Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.</br>
              <br>Romeo O, then, dear saint let lips do what hands do:</br>
              <br>They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.</br>
              <br>Juliet Saints do not move, through grant for prayers’ sake.</br>
              <br>Romeo Then move not, while my prayer’s effect I take.</br>
              <br>Thus from my lips, by thine, my sin is purged.</br>
              <br>Juliet Then have my lips the sin that they have took.</br>
              <br>Romeo Sin from my lips? O, trespass sweetly urged!</br>
              <br>Give me my sin again. </br>
              <br>Juliet You kiss by th’book </br></p>


              - Romeo and Juliet Act 1 Scene 4

              <p>The Tempest</p>
              <p>Spirits to enforce, art to enchant,
                And my ending is despair.
                Unless I be relieved by prayer...Let your indulgence set me free</p>

              <p>-the juxtaposition of magical and religious themes in The Tempest - a story of those marooned on an
                Island of magic-is brought to a happy close in this comedy and its epilogue. If you pick up the play-
                without revealing any spoliers- mercy prevails at the end. </p>
              <h3>Famed Sonnets</h3>
              <p>In this sonnet Shakespeare is enchanted by his own ageing process and its vanity.</p>
             <p> <br>Sonnet 62<br>
              <br>Sin of self-love possesseth all mine eye<br>
              <br>And all my soul and all my every part,<br>
              <br>And for this sin there is no remedy.<br>
              <br>It is grounded inward in my heart. <br>
              <br>Methinks no face so gracious is as mine,<br>
              <br>No shape so true, no truth of such account,<br>
              <br>And for myself mine own worth do define,<br>
              <br>As I all other in all worths surmount.<br>
              <br>But when my glass shows me myself indeed.<br>
              <br>Beated and chopped with tanned antiquity.<br>
              <br>Mine own self-love quite contrary I read:<br>
              <br>Self so self-loving were iniquity.<br>
              <br>‘Tis thee, my self, that for myself I praise.<br>
              <br>Painting my age with beauty of thy days. <br></p>
