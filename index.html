    </div>
    <p><br>One William Shakespeare born c.1564 a playwright with drama to his name, poet by nature multiple sonnets
        under his nom de plume,as relevant now as in the 16th century? That's for you to decide...</p><br>
    <br><p>His themes? So universal that even today his works are reinterpreted on stage, in films, in text and quoted in real life.  Life, death, birth, youth and ageing. Witchcraft, ghosts and mysticism. Pilgrimage,
    apothecaries, confusion, revenge, forgiveness, prologues, epilogues, monologues and <em>In Media Res</em>. Every
    juxtaposition you can imagine love and hatred, religious allegory. From the most average of society to those in the
    loftiest position in his plays we encounter all.From the famous two households both alike in dignity of the Capulets
    and Montagues - truly families at war in Romeo and Juliet- to Kings and Queens, the marooned magic of The Tempest to
    heterodox romantic pairings and sometimes orthodox-and not so orthodox- societal reactions. The <em>dramatis
        personae</em> of Shakespeare's plays are a variegated bunch.Like to see where Shakespeare originated? Look no further than the images below of his still extant homes in Stratford-upon-Avon.</br></p>
