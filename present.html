            <h3>Late Elizabethan Era</h3>
            <p>Some historical context to Shakespeare’s plays he commenced his work during the reign of Queen Elizabeth
                I daughter of Henry VIII. At this time in history a Protestant country largely due to the Reformation
                during Henry VIII’s reign. While Romeo and Juliet references pilgrims- Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales some
                three hundred years earlier and the predominantly Catholic pilgrimages made during the middle ages which
                ended in the Elizabethan era add a religious allegory to the play alongside the romance of the tragedy.
                Shakespeare’s work references his cultural milieu and his oeuvre is influenced by his environs whether
                his is an aside to the countryside and his knowledge of plant life – see the unctions and potions of
                Romeo and Juliet and the Friar-come-apothecary or references to the Royal Court of which Shakespeare
                enjoyed a patronage under the Lord Chamberlains Men as an actor and then a playwright with a number of
                plays written for earlier eponyms of Queen Elizabeth I’s father- the Henry plays. Moreover one of
                Shakespeare’s most problematic plays The Taming of the Shrew was performed during Her Majesty’s reign.
                It may therefore have been more ironic than at first viewing for here was a formidable woman on the
                throne, accustomed to the machinations at court, viewing a subjugated woman on stage. </p>
        </div>

            <h3>Mid-Transition Period</h3>
            24th March 1603 heralded a new era for Shakespeare, a country a court and a male regent. King James I of
            King James bible fame -the bible was translated from Latin into English for the first time accessible to the
            masses during his reign – was crowned King following the passing of Queen Elizabeth I and on 25th July 1603
            to quote Shakespeare Heavy is the head that wears the crown from Henry IV a play released in 1592. Here we
            see a marked change in Shakespeare’s work for of course continued patronage was not assured he had to curry
            favour with the new monarch. This he did with aplomb negotiating into The King’s Men theatre troupe enjoying
            a renewed patronage, Shakespeare’s globe theatre built in 1613, and the rewards of court.

            <p>Plays in this period include All’s Well That Ends Well overlapping two reigns and notably referencing a
                king as the final monologue before the epilogue with content of marriage as the thread upon which the
                driving force of the play hangs. King James I was married to Anne of Denmark in 1589 The Virgin Queen
                presumably never married. For Shakespeare he may have feared that all was well-ended for him prior to
                his future success under his new patron and thus the titular play he may also have rehashed the play
                into a new form to be pleasing to a new patron.<em>All is well-ended if this suit be won</em> it’s an
                appeal <em> in media res</em> and a historically successful one.<p>

        </div>

        <div>
            <p>Jacobean Period</p>
            A markéd number of tragedies occur in this period more pathos than bathos more sober king perhaps than
            comic-inclined Queen and antithetically Shakespeare himself not so filled with cheer due to coinciding life
            events the death of his son Hamnet was sure to have had a far-reaching impact at this time. Thankfully some
            of Shakespeare’s most well-renowned plays reached inception during this era: Romeo and Juliet, Othello, the
            tragic Hamlet the play moniker hanging over the death of Shakespeare and Anne’s twinned boy Hamnet – the
            names were interchangeable. It could be postulated that the famous Sonnet 18 Shall I Compare Thee To A
            Summer’s Day is to immortalise their child across the ages. </p>

            <p>King Lear, Macbeth, there are more male protagonists plays during this period and seemingly all know
                betrayal however with strong female antagonists take The Tempest’s Miranda as one such example,
                Prospero’s daughter is headstrong and self-assured or Lear’s daughter Cordelia with the famed story of
                the salt. Axiomatic by nature as well as religious allegory there is a parable nature to the plays more
                so in the Jacobean era. The plays also contain a underlying bawd, there is paronomasia at work
                frequently and stichoymethia as enjoyable to those looking for Shakesperean insults as those looking for
                verbal as well as on stage jousting of which as in Romeo and Juliet proving as fatal to Mercutio as
                Romeo’s Thanatos/Eros drive. In short as Marcus Aurelius stated the soul becomes dyed with the colour of
                its thoughts and Shakepeare’s plays with the shade of his courts. Artistic freedom was further curtailed
                in 1624 and post-humously in 1642. Plague may have shut up the theatres during Shakespeare’s time on
                stage but the Puritans put paid to all non-religious entertainment just as Christianity put an end to
                Roman polytheist <em>largesse</em> to quote from the play Julius Ceasar
                <em> And keep us all in servile fearfulness</em> Act 1 Scene 2. </p>
