            <h3>Late Elizabethan Era</h3>
            <p>Some historical context to Shakespeare’s plays he commenced his work during the reign of Queen Elizabeth
                I daughter of Henry VIII. At this time in history Britain was a Protestant country largely due to the
                Reformation
                during Henry VIII’s reign. Shakespeare's plays are peppered with references to the historical changes
                around him for example in Romeo and Juliet there are references to pilgrims. Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales
                some
                three hundred years earlier covered in text the predominantly Catholic pilgrimages made during the
                middle ages which then following the Reformation
                ended in the Elizabethan era. There is therefore unwitting testimony of social commentary a historical
                record of sorts within Shakespeare's works.</p>

            <p>Shakespeare’s work references his cultural milieu and his oeuvre is influenced by his environs whether
                this is an aside to the countryside and his knowledge of plant life – see the unctions and potions of
                the play
                Romeo and Juliet and the Friar-come-apothecary - or references to the Royal Court of which Shakespeare
                enjoyed a patronage under the Lord Chamberlains Men as an actor and then later as a playwright.

                <p>With a number of eponymous plays written for Queen Elizabeth I’s concerning her Royal predecessors-
                    the Henry plays of which Shakespeare wrote quite a number- there are many references to Royal life.
                    Moreover one of
                    Shakespeare’s most problematic plays <em>The Taming of the Shrew</em> was performed during Her
                    Majesty’s reign.
                    Here in Shakespeare's time a formidable woman on the throne, Queen Elizabeth I accustomed to the
                    machinations at court especially embodied in the divide with her sister Mary and the religious
                    divide of the kingdom, viewing a subjugated woman on stage which either made for in its time ironic
                    or equal to this day uncomfortable viewing. This play however must have struck a chord somewhere for
                    it is assumed to be one of the earliest plays written by Shakespeare and a patronage may have ensued
                    consequently it can be surmised. Such a patronage sustained Shakespeare and his actors throughout
                    his life and while others struggled his career bloomed over time. </p>

            <h3>Mid-Transition Period</h3>
            <p> A coronation. 24th March 1603 heralded a new era for Shakespeare, a country a court and a male regent.
                King James I of
                King James bible fame -the bible was translated from Latin into English for the first time accessible to
                the
                masses during his reign – was crowned King following the passing of Queen Elizabeth I and on 25th July
                1603
                to quote Shakespeare:
                'Heavy is the head that wears the crown'
                -from Henry IV a play released in 1592.
                Here we see a marked change in Shakespeare’s work for of course continued patronage was not assured he
                had to curry
                favour with the new monarch. This he did with aplomb negotiating into The King’s Men theatre troupe
                enjoying
                a renewed patronage, Shakespeare’s globe theatre built in 1613, and the rewards of court.</p>

            <p>Plays in this period include <em>All’s Well That Ends Well</em> overlapping two reigns and notably
                referencing a
                king as the final monologue before the epilogue with content of marriage as the thread upon which the
                driving force of the play hangs. King James I was married to Anne of Denmark in 1589. For Shakespeare he
                may have feared that all was well-ended for him prior to
                his future success under his new patron and thus the titular play he may also have rehashed the play
                into a new form to be pleasing to a new patron.<em>All is well-ended if this suit be won</em> it’s an
                appeal and a historically successful one.<p>

        <div>
            <h3>Jacobean Period</h3>
            <p> The reign of King James I. A markéd number of tragedies occur in this period more pathos than bathos
                more sober king perhaps than
                comic-inclined Queen and antithetically Shakespeare himself not so filled with cheer due to coinciding
                life
                events the death of his son Hamnet was sure to have had a far-reaching impact at this time.</p>

            <p> Thankfully some of Shakespeare’s most well-renowned plays reached inception during this era: Romeo and
                Juliet, Othello, the
                tragic Hamlet the play moniker hanging over the death of Shakespeare and Anne’s twinned boy Hamnet – the
                names were interchangeable. It could be postulated that the famous Sonnet 18 Shall I Compare Thee To A
                Summer’s Day is to immortalise their child across the ages. </p>

            <p>King Lear, Macbeth, there are more male protagonists plays during this period -and seemingly all know
                betrayal. However small their part there are smatterings of strong female antagonists within
                Shakespeare's plays during the Jacobean period. Take The Tempest’s Miranda as one such example,
                Prospero’s daughter is headstrong and self-assured or Lear’s daughter Cordelia with the famed story of
                the salt. In short as Emperor Marcus Aurelius stated 'the soul becomes dyed with the colour of
                its thoughts' and Shakepeare’s plays it could be postulated with the shade of his courts.

                <p>Artistic freedom was post-humously curtailed in 1642. Plague may have shut up the theatres during
                    Shakespeare’s time on
                    stage but the Puritans put paid to all non-religious entertainment just as Christianity put an end
                    to
                    Roman polytheist <em>largesse</em>. Yet Shakespeare still survives to this day and is oft
                    reinterpreted for a modern audiences.</p>
