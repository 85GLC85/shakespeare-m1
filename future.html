<h4>The Future of Shakespeare's Works</h4>
<p>Shakespeare's relevance is due to the universal themes of his works. Even in an increasingly automated age there is space for appreciation of the arts. In the future will robots be performing Shakespeare's plays as in the below image? Who knows but one thing is true if Shaekspeare has surmounted the challenges of time through his lines it is due to reinterpretation on stage and in film, in novels and in the application of his pithy axioms in real life. One day as in the below image it may be automatons performing his works who knows what the future has in store?</p>
